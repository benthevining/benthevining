### Hi :wave: I'm Ben :sparkles:

I'm an audio programmer :computer: :neckbeard: and electronic musician :electric_plug: :musical_keyboard: :lips: in Phoenix, AZ, United States

I specialize in creating pitch shifting effects, particularly for the [voice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIzHT1uJxA4) :microphone: :sound:

I got started in coding with learning [Max/MSP](http://www.cycling74.com/products/max), and I've now transitioned to coding in C++ using the [JUCE framework](http://www.juce.com/).
