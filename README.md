### Hi, I'm Ben ðŸ‘‹

I'm an audio programmer and electronic musician in Phoenix, AZ, United States. I specialize in creating pitch shifting effects, particularly for the [voice](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIzHT1uJxA4). I got started in coding with learning [Max/MSP](http://www.cycling74.com/products/max), and I've now transitioned to coding in C++ using the [JUCE framework](http://www.juce.com/).

To buy the finished versions of my software, head to [Gumroad](http://www.gumroad.com/benvining).
